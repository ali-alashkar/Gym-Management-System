# Gym Management System

## Overview

This project is a **Gym Management System** developed in **C++** and later extended with a **Qt-based graphical user interface**. The system is designed to manage gym operations such as members, staff, coaches, workouts, subscriptions, bookings, and padel court management using object-oriented programming principles.

The project was built as an academic and practical application to strengthen understanding of **OOP, file handling, and GUI development**.

## Features

* Member registration and management
* Staff and coach management
* Workout and workout history tracking
* Subscription management
* Booking system (Gym / Padel courts)
* Revenue and reports handling
* Data persistence using text files
* Qt GUI with drag-and-drop UI design

---

## Technologies Used

* **C++** (Core logic & OOP)
* **Qt Framework** (GUI)
* **Qt Designer** for UI files (`.ui`)
* **Text files** for data storage

## How to Run

1. Open the project using **Qt Creator**
2. Load the `.pro` file
3. Configure the kit (Desktop Qt)
4. Build and run the project

Alternatively, the project can be compiled using a compatible C++ compiler if running the console version.
